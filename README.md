### This Repository, is a special repository dedicated to Javascript Land - An awesome team-learning community that is powered by a system of learning called - "accountability learning".

> The repository contains 4 github branches - the 'main' default branch, and three other branches ('next-js-track', 'soft-skills-track', and the 'vanilla-js-track'). Each of those branches are for decumenting my learning progresses repectively, in the three learning tracks/skills that I am currently working on - Next.js, Vanilla Js, and soft-skills.
